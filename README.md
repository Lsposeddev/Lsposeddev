### 💡 **Learning Philosophy**
"**The best way to predict the future is to create it.**" – Alan Kay  
I'm committed to creating **machine learning models** that not only solve problems but also **push the boundaries** of what’s possible with data. From **statistical analysis** to building intelligent systems, my goal is to grow **one algorithm at a time**.

#### 🚀 **A few things I’m focused on right now:**
- **Feature Engineering** 🔧
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** 🔬
- **Model Optimization** ⚙️
- **Deploying ML models to production** 🌍


### 🎯 **Goals for the Year**  
- 📚 Complete 5 end-to-end machine learning projects.
- 🎓 Master deep learning concepts and neural networks.
- 🌍 Contribute to open-source projects & engage with the ML community.
